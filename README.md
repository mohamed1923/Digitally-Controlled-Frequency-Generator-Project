# Digitally-Controlled-Frequency-Generator-Project
This project is based on AT89S51/52 microcontrollers. The target is to generate a square
wave with different frequencies up to 9999 Hz. The frequency will be entered via a hex keypad
and displayed on a quad seven segment display. After entering the frequency value, a push button
connected to INT0 is pressed to enable the generation of the square wave .
